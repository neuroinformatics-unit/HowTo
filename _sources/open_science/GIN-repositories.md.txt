# Create a GIN repository for your dataset

[GIN](https://gin.g-node.org/G-Node/Info/wiki) (hosted by the German Neuroinformatics Node) is a free and open data management system designed for neuroscientific data.

It is web-accessible, based on [`git`](https://git-scm.com/) and [`git-annex`](https://git-annex.branchable.com/), and allows you to keep your data in sync, backed up and easily accessible.

Below we explain the main user workflows in GIN.


## Preparatory steps - do only once

We need to do these steps only the first time we use GIN's command-line interface (CLI) on our machine.

1. Create [a GIN account](https://gin.g-node.org/user/sign_up).
2. [Download GIN CLI](https://gin.g-node.org/G-Node/Info/wiki/GIN+CLI+Setup#setup-gin-client) and set it up by running:
   ```
   $ gin login
   ```
   You will be prompted for your GIN username and password.
3. Confirm that everything is working properly by typing:
   ```
   $ gin --version
   ```

## Create a GIN repository

To create a local and a remote GIN repository, follow these steps:

1. **Log in to the GIN server**

   Before running any `gin` commands, make sure you are logged in to your account by running:

   ```
   $ gin login
   ```

:::{tip}
In Unix-like systems (Ubuntu, MacOS), you may need `sudo` permissions for some of the following `gin` commands. If so, remember to prepend all commands with `sudo`.
:::

2. **Initialise a GIN repository**

    ::::{tab-set}

    :::{tab-item} In a new directory

    - Create a new GIN repository locally and on the GIN server:

      ```
      $ gin create <repository-name>
      ```
      This will create a repository called `<repository-name>` on the GIN server under your user account, and a directory with the same name in the current working directory.

      <details><summary> <b> OR alternatively: </b> </summary>

      Create a repository in the GIN server [from the browser](https://gin.g-node.org/repo/create), and clone (retrieve) it to your local workspace:

      ```
      $ gin get <username>/<remote-repository-name>
      ```

      </details>

    - Next, move or copy files to the newly created directory to add data to the local GIN repository.
    :::

    :::{tab-item} In an existing directory
    - Move to the relevant directory using `cd`.

    - Create a new repository on the GIN server and locally in the current working directory:

      ```
      $ gin create --here <repository-name>
      ```
      This will create a repository named `<repository-name>` on the GIN server under your user account and link it to the current working directory.

      <details><summary> <b> OR alternatively: </b> </summary>

      - Initialise the current working directory as a GIN repository:

        ```
        $ gin init
        ```

      - Add a remote:

        ```
        $ gin add-remote <remote-name> <remote-repository-location>
        ```

        where `<remote-name>` is the name you want to give to the remote (e.g. `origin`) and `<remote-repository-location>` is the location of the data store, which should be in the form of alias:path or server:path (e.g. `gin:<username>/<remote-repository-name>`).

      - If the remote GIN repository doesn't exist, you will be prompted to either create it, add simply the remote address, or abort.
      </details>
    :::
    ::::


:::{note}
Initialising the GIN local repository (with `gin create` or `gin init`) will create a hidden `.git` directory under the local repository directory. The local repository excluding this `.git` folder is what we will later call the _working directory_.
:::


3. **Add files to the GIN remote repository**

   It is good practice to keep a record of the changes in the repository through commit messages. To keep a useful and clean commit history, it is also recommended to make small commits by selecting a subset of the files.

   - To add a record of the current state of a local repository, run:

     ```
     $ gin commit --message <message> <filename>
     ```

     You can replace the `<filename>` above by an expression with a wildcard (e.g., `*.png` to include all png files). It can also be a list of files separated by whitespaces. A `<filename>` equal to `.` will include all files with changes. See the full syntax for `gin commit` [here](https://gin.g-node.org/G-Node/Info/wiki/GIN+CLI+Help#record-changes-in-local-repository).

   - To upload all local changes to the remote GIN repository, run:

     ```
     $ gin upload <filename>
     ```

     `<filename>` accepts the same inputs as in `gin commit`. You can run an upload command after a few commits (so not necessarily after every commit).

     You can use the flag `--to <remote-name>` to upload the changes to a specific remote. To show the remotes accessible to your GIN account, run `gin remotes`. See the full syntax for `gin upload` [here](https://gin.g-node.org/G-Node/Info/wiki/GIN+CLI+Help#upload-local-changes-to-a-remote-repository).

     If the set of files in the `gin upload` command includes files that have been changed locally but have not been committed, they will be automatically committed when uploading.

     After running `gin upload`, the data will be uploaded to the GIN server and it will be possible to retrieve it later from there. However, notice the upload command sends all changes made in the directory to the GIN server, including deletions, renames, etc. Therefore, if you delete files from the directory on your computer and perform a `gin upload`, the file will be removed from the server as well. Such changes can be synchronized by simply running `git upload` (i.e., without specifying any files). See further details in the [GIN docs](https://gin.g-node.org/G-Node/Info/wiki/GIN+CLI+Usage+Tutorial#basic-workflow-only-using-gin).

4. **Consider whether to lock the data**

   You may want to lock the data to save space locally or to prevent editing in the future — see the section on [File locking](#file-locking) for further details.

:::{tip}
 - Use `gin ls` to check on the current status of the GIN repository (if your are familiar with `git`, is is somewhat equivalent to `git status`). The file status acronyms used in the output are described [here](https://gin.g-node.org/G-Node/Info/wiki/GIN+CLI+Help#list-the-sync-status-of-files-in-the-local-repository).
 - Use `gin sync` to sync the changes bi-directionally between the local and the remote GIN repository.
 - If the output from `gin ls` doesn't look right (e.g., files already uploaded to the GIN server appear under `Locally modified (unsaved)`), try running `gin sync` and check the status again.
 - To logout from the GIN CLI session in the terminal, run `gin logout`.
:::



### Is this repository public or private?

By default, all newly-created GIN repos are private.

To make a GIN repository public:

1. Go to the homepage of the remote repository. You can see the URLs for the repositories you have access to by running `gin repos --all`.
1. Click on _Settings_ (top right).
1. Unselect the _Private_ checkbox under the _Basic settings_ section.

## Download a GIN dataset

To download a dataset from the GIN server to a local machine, follow these steps:

::::{tab-set}

:::{tab-item} If the local repository doesn't exist

1. If the repository does not exist locally, clone it from the GIN remote server:

   ```
   $ gin get <remote-repository-location>
   ```

   This command will clone to repository to the current working directory, and download the large files in your dataset as lightweight placeholders.

2. To download the content of the placeholder files, run:
   ```
   $ gin download --content
   ```
   If the large files in the dataset are **_locked_**, this command will download the content to the git annex subdirectory, and turn the placeholder files in the working directory into symlinks that point to the content.

   If the files are **_unlocked_**, this command will replace the placeholder files in the working directory with the full-content files and **also** download the content to the git annex locally.

   See the section on [File locking](#file-locking) for further details.
:::

:::{tab-item} If the local repository repository exists

1. If the repository already exists locally, we only need to download any changes from the remote. To do this, run from the GIN local repository:

   ```
   $ gin download
   ```

   This command will create new files that were added remotely, delete files that were removed, and update files that were changed. By default, new files are added as empty placeholders.

   To retrieve the content of all files in the repository, run the download command with the optional `--content` flag. See the [GIN docs](https://gin.g-node.org/G-Node/Info/wiki/GIN+CLI+Help#download-all-new-information-from-a-remote-repository) for further details.
:::
::::

:::{tip}
The content of individual files can be retrieved using:
   ```
   $ gin get-content <filename>
   ```
   and removed with:
   ```
   $ gin remove-content <filename>
   ```
:::

## Update a GIN dataset

To update a dataset hosted in GIN:
1. First clone the repository locally by running:

   ```
   $ gin get <remote-repository-location>
   ```

   To see the `<remote-repository-location>`s accessible from your GIN account, run `gin repos --all`.

2. Copy or move the required files to the local repository and log the changes with a commit:

   ```
   $ gin commit -m <message> <filename>
   ```

3. Upload the committed changes to the GIN server:
   ```
   $ gin upload <filename>
   ```

:::{tip}
- To [unannex a file](https://gin.g-node.org/G-Node/Info/wiki/FAQ+Troubleshooting#how-to-unannex-files), that is, to remove a file from the GIN tracking before uploading:
  ```
  $ gin git annex unannex [path/filename]
  ```

- To stop tracking an existing directory as a GIN repository, delete the `.git` directory.
  - If in the directory we want to stop tracking the files are locked, remember to unlock them before deleting the `.git` directory! Otherwise we may not be able to delete the `.git/annex` content.
:::



## File locking
[File locking](https://gin.g-node.org/G-Node/Info/wiki/GIN+CLI+Usage+Tutorial#file-locking) is an important part of GIN repositories. Below are the main ideas behind this.

Files in a GIN repository can be **_locked_** or **_unlocked_**. The lock state relates to the nature of the placeholder files we get in the working directory when we clone the remote repository via `gin get <remote-repository-location>`:

  - **on Unix-like systems** (MacOS, Ubuntu):
    - if a file is **_locked_**, its corresponding placeholder file will be a **_symlink_**. These symlinks point to the annexed content (under `.git/annex/objects`). We can open the files in the working directory (using the symlinks) but we can't modify them.
    - If a file is **_unlocked_**, the placeholder file in the working directory is an **_ASCII text file_** with a path. The path is approximately where the content of the file will be downloaded to when we request it.
  - **on Windows**:
    - if a file is **_locked_**, the placeholder file is a **_plain text file_** with a path pointing to the content in the git annex (but see caution below!).
    - If a file is **_unlocked_**, the behaviour is the same as in Unix-like systems.

The lock state of a file is **_persistent_**. This means that if we clone a GIN (remote) repository whose files are unlocked, we lock them in the local copy, and then upload the local repository to the GIN server, the next time someone clones the GIN repository the files they fetch will be locked.

Unlocked files can be edited. If the data is unlocked and the full content of the dataset is downloaded locally, the file in the working directory has content, and so does its copy under git annex.

:::{caution}
Note that if we download the contents of unlocked files locally, the disk usage of the files checked into the repo doubles, because the content exists both in the working directory and under the git annex. But in exchange users can modify and revert files to previous commits.
:::

:::{caution}
We have observed that it is possible to unintentionally overwrite locked files on Windows. Please be careful and double-check the output of `gin ls` before uploading. You may also want to read [about `git-annex` on Windows](https://gin.g-node.org/G-Node/Info/wiki/Some+Notes+On+Git+Annex) if you are considering using `git-annex` directly.
:::

Locked files cannot be edited. For example, if we open a locked image with Preview in MacOS and try to edit it, we will be asked if we wish to unlock the file. However, even if we do unlock it, we won't be able to save any changes because we don't have writing permissions.

Files need to be committed before locking. We can switch the locking state for one or more files with:
  ```
  $ gin lock <filename>
  ```
  and
  ```
  $ gin unlock <filename>
  ```
After changing the locking state, remember to record the new state with a `gin commit`!

**Recommendations from the GIN docs on when to lock / unlock data:**
- Keep files **_unlocked_** if the workflow requires editing large files and keeping snapshots of the progress. But keep in mind this will increase storage use with every commit of a file.
- Keep files **_locked_** if using the repository's main goal is long term storage as an archive, if files are only to be read, and if the filesystem supports symlinks. This will save extra storage of keeping two copies of the same file.

## Download a GIN dataset with Python

We recommend [pooch](https://www.fatiando.org/pooch/latest/index.html) to programmatically download a dataset from a GIN repository's URL. `pooch` is easy to use and has some nice
functionalities like caching the downloaded data, verifying cryptographic hashes or unzipping files upon download.

Here is a simple example of how to download a dataset from a GIN repository using `pooch`:

```python
import pooch

filepath = pooch.retrieve(
    url="https://gin.g-node.org/<username>/<repository>/src/main/file",
    known_hash=None,
    path="/home/<user>/downloads", # this is where the file will be saved
    progressbar=True,
)
```

## Some under-the-hood details

GIN is a wrapper around [git-annex](https://git-annex.branchable.com/). The high-level idea behind git-annex is:
  - `git` is designed to track small text files, and doesn't cope well with large binary files.
  - `git-annex` bypasses this by using git only to track the names and metadata (hashes) of these large binary files, but not their content.

The content of these large binary files is only retrieved on demand.

Indeed, when we `gin download` a repository from the GIN server, we get a local "copy" (clone) of the dataset in our machine, but this is not strictly a copy. This is because the large binary files that make up this dataset will only be downloaded as placeholders.

:::{dropdown} How? Case for an unlocked dataset

  - If the dataset is unlocked, these placeholder files have the same filenames (and paths) as the corresponding original files, but are instead simply ASCII text files. If we open these placeholder files, we see they contain a path. This path is where the actual content of the corresponding file will be downloaded to, when we request it.

  - For example, if the placeholder ASCII text file with name `image.png` points to this path:
    ```
    /annex/objects/MD5-s15081575--f0a21c00672ab7ed0733951a652d4b49
    ```
    And when we specifically request for this file's content with:
    ```
    gin get-content image.png
    ```
    the actual png file is downloaded to:
    ```
    .git/annex/objects/Xq/7G/MD5-s15081575--f0a21c00672ab7ed0733951a652d4b49/MD5-s15081575--f0a21c00672ab7ed0733951a652d4b49
    ```
    Notice that the path in the ASCII file and the actual path are somewhat different (the actual path contains some additional directories under `objects`).

    We can actually verify this file is the actual image by opening it with an image viewer (e.g. Preview in MacOS):
    ```
    open -a Preview .git/annex/objects/Xq/7G/MD5-s15081575--f0a21c00672ab7ed0733951a652d4b49/MD5-s15081575--f0a21c00672ab7ed0733951a652d4b49
    ```
:::


:::{dropdown} How? Case for a locked dataset
  - If the dataset is locked and no content has been downloaded, the symlinks in the working directory will be broken (since there is no data in the git annex to retrieve).
  - To get the actual content in the git annex, we need to run `gin download --content`. This will fetch the content from the GIN server. After this, the symlinks in the working directory should work.
:::

:::{dropdown} How? Case for a new (or updated) local repository
- If we want to create (or update) a GIN repository, we would initialise (or clone) it locally, add files and commit the changes.
- When committing, the data is "copied" from the working directory to the git annex. You can verify this by checking the size of the `.git` folder before and after running `git commit`.
- When we lock the data with `gin lock <path-to-data>`, the files in the working directory are replaced with symlinks to the git annex content.
- If after locking the data we commit the state change and upload the changes to the GIN server., the files will stay locked for any future retrievals of the repository.

<!-- ## Other useful tips

- To [unannex a file](https://gin.g-node.org/G-Node/Info/wiki/FAQ+Troubleshooting#how-to-unannex-files), that is, to remove a file from the GIN tracking before uploading:

  ```
  $ gin git annex unannex [path/filename]
  ```

- To stop tracking the GIN repo locally, delete the `.git` directory.

  :::{note}
  If in the GIN repo the files are locked, remember to unlock them before removing the `.git` directory! Otherwise we won't be able to delete the `.git/annex` content.
  :::

- To delete a GIN repository but keep the git repo:

  1. Delete the repository in the GIN server via the browser.
  2. Delete the GIN local repository with `git annex uninit`.
    - This command removes relevant bits in `.git/annex` and `.git/objects`, but some pre-commits may need to be edited by hand (see this [SO post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24447047/remove-git-annex-repository-from-file-tree)). -->
