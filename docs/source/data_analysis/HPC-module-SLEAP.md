## Prerequisites

::: {dropdown} Note on managed Linux desktops
:color: info
:icon: info

SWC's IT team offers managed Linux desktops with direct access to SLURM, the HPC modules, and the SWC filesystem. If you have one, you can skip the prerequisite steps: open a terminal, run `module load SLEAP`, and use SLEAP directly (including `sleap label` for the GUI).

You may still want to offload GPU-intensive work to an HPC node (e.g. for more powerful GPUs or parallel jobs). In that case, read the sections on [model training](sleap-training) and [inference](sleap-inference).
:::

(access-to-the-hpc-cluster)=
### Access to the HPC cluster
Verify that you can access HPC gateway node (typing your `<SWC-PASSWORD>` both times when prompted):
```{code-block} console
$ ssh <SWC-USERNAME>@ssh.swc.ucl.ac.uk
$ ssh hpc-gw2
```
To learn more about accessing the HPC via SSH, see the [relevant how-to guide](ssh-cluster-target).

### Access to the SLEAP module
Once you are on the HPC gateway node, you can see the available SLEAP modules by running `module avail SLEAP`:

```{code-block} console
$ module avail SLEAP
----------------------- /ceph/apps/ubuntu-24/modulefiles-----------------------
   ...  SLEAP/2025-09-30    SLEAP/2026-05-08 (D)

  Where:
   D:  Default Module
...
```
- `SLEAP/2026-05-08` corresponds to `SLEAP v.1.6.3` ([PyTorch backend](https://docs.sleap.ai/)) — this is the recommended module for all new projects, and what this guide documents.
- Older modules use the legacy TensorFlow backend (e.g. `SLEAP/2025-09-30` is `SLEAP v.1.3.4`). Load these by full name if you need to maintain compatibility with an existing project, and refer to the [legacy SLEAP documentation](https://legacy.sleap.ai/). Modules with dates before `2025-09-30` are no longer recommended (built for an older Ubuntu).

If a module has been successfully loaded, it will be listed among
other loaded modules when you run `module list`:

```{code-block} console
$ module list
Currently Loaded Modulefiles:
...   15) SLEAP/2026-05-08
```

If you have troubles with loading the SLEAP module,
see this guide's [Troubleshooting section](#problems-with-the-sleap-module).

:::{note}
The SLEAP CLI commands `sleap train` and `sleap track` are aliases for
`sleap-nn train` and `sleap-nn track` respectively; the two forms work
interchangeably. For a full list of arguments, run `<command> --help`
(with the SLEAP module loaded) or consult the SLEAP-NN documentation on
[training](https://nn.sleap.ai/latest/guides/training/),
[inference](https://nn.sleap.ai/latest/guides/inference/) and
[tracking](https://nn.sleap.ai/latest/guides/tracking/).
:::


### Install SLEAP on your local PC/laptop
While you can delegate the GPU-intensive work to the HPC cluster,
you will need to use the SLEAP GUI for some steps, such as labelling frames.
Thus, you also need to install SLEAP on your local PC/laptop.

We recommend following the official [SLEAP installation guide](https://docs.sleap.ai/latest/installation/).
To minimise the risk of issues due to incompatibilities between versions, ensure the version of your local installation of SLEAP matches the one you plan to load in the cluster.

For, example, to match the latest SLEAP module at the time of writing (`SLEAP/2026-05-08`),
you will need to run the following command in your local terminal:

```{code-block} console
uv tool install --python 3.13 "sleap[nn]==1.6.3" --with "sleap-io==0.7.0" --with "sleap-nn==0.2.0" --torch-backend auto
```

### Mount the SWC filesystem on your local PC/laptop
The rest of this guide assumes that you have mounted the SWC filesystem on your local PC/laptop.
If you have not done so, please follow the relevant instructions on the
[SWC internal wiki](https://liveuclac.sharepoint.com/sites/SSC/SitePages/SSC-SWC-Storage-Platform-Overview-198905992.aspx).

We will also assume that the data you are working with are stored in a `ceph`
directory to which you have access to. In the rest of this guide, we will use the path
`/ceph/scratch/neuroinformatics-dropoff/SLEAP_HPC_test_data` which contains a SLEAP project
for test purposes. You should replace this with the path to your own data.

:::{dropdown} Data storage location matters
:color: warning
:icon: alert-fill

The cluster has fast access to data stored on the `ceph` filesystem, so if your
data is stored elsewhere, make sure to transfer it to `ceph` before running the job.
You can use tools such as [`rsync`](https://linux.die.net/man/1/rsync)
to copy data from your local machine to `ceph` via an ssh connection. For example:

```{code-block} console
$ rsync -avz <LOCAL-DIR> <SWC-USERNAME>@ssh.swc.ucl.ac.uk:/ceph/scratch/neuroinformatics-dropoff/SLEAP_HPC_test_data
```
:::

(sleap-training)=
## Model training
This will consist of two parts: [preparing a training job](prepare-the-training-job)
(on your local SLEAP installation) and [running a training job](run-the-training-job)
(on the HPC cluster's SLEAP module). Some evaluation metrics for the trained models
can be [viewed via the SLEAP GUI](model-evaluation) on your local SLEAP installation.

(prepare-the-training-job)=
### Prepare the training job
Follow the [SLEAP tutorial](https://docs.sleap.ai/latest/tutorial/overview/) till
the end of the section on [Initial Labelling](https://docs.sleap.ai/latest/tutorial/initial-labeling/).
Ensure that the project file (e.g. `labels.v002.slp`) is saved in the mounted SWC filesystem
(as opposed to your local filesystem).

Next, read the [Training a model](https://docs.sleap.ai/latest/tutorial/training-a-model/) section
of the tutorial, but **do not hit the `Run` button** in the SLEAP GUI just yet
(that would run the training job on your local machine, which is not what we want).
Instead, follow the instructions in the [Running SLEAP remotely](https://docs.sleap.ai/latest/guides/running-sleap-remotely/) guide,
i.e. *Predict* -> *Run Training…* -> *Export Training Job Package…*.

- For selecting the right configuration parameters, see the [Model Configuration](https://nn.sleap.ai/latest/reference/models/) guide.
- Set the *Inference Target* parameter to *Nothing*. Remote training and inference (prediction) are easiest to run separately on the HPC Cluster.
- Make sure to save the exported training job package (e.g. `labels.v002.slp.training_job.zip`) in the mounted SWC filesystem, for example, in the same directory as the project file.
- Unzip the training job package. This will create a folder with the same name (minus the `.zip` extension). This folder contains everything needed to run the training job on the HPC cluster: YAML configuration files and a packaged labels file (`.pkg.slp`).

(run-the-training-job)=
### Run the training job
Login to the HPC cluster as described above.
```{code-block} console
$ ssh <SWC-USERNAME>@ssh.swc.ucl.ac.uk
$ ssh hpc-gw2
```
Navigate to the training job folder (replace with your own path) and list its contents:
```{code-block} console
$ cd /ceph/scratch/neuroinformatics-dropoff/SLEAP_HPC_test_data
$ cd labels.v002.slp.training_job
$ ls -1
centered_instance.yaml
centroid.yaml
inference-script.sh
jobs.yaml
labels.v002.pkg.slp
train-script.sh
```

The YAML configuration files specify the model architecture, training hyperparameters,
and data pipeline settings for each model. You can inspect them with
`cat centroid.yaml` or open them in a text editor.

The precise files will depend on the model configuration you chose in SLEAP.
Here we see two config files, one for the 'centroid' and another for
the 'centered_instance' model. That's because in this example we have chosen
the 'Top-Down' configuration, which consists of two neural networks - the first
for isolating the animal instances (by finding their centroids) and the second
for predicting all the body parts per instance.

![Top-Down model configuration](https://legacy.sleap.ai/_images/topdown_approach.jpg)

:::{dropdown} More on 'Top-Down' vs 'Bottom-Up' models
:color: info
:icon: info

Although the 'Top-Down' configuration was designed with multiple animals in mind,
it can also be used for single-animal videos. It makes sense to use it for videos
where the animal occupies a relatively small portion of the frame - see
[Model Configuration](https://nn.sleap.ai/latest/reference/models/) for more info.
:::

SLEAP also generates a `train-script.sh` file in the training job folder.
You can inspect it with `cat train-script.sh` to see the training commands it contains —
these are useful as a reference, but they reflect the paths on the machine that
exported the training job package and may not work as-is on the HPC cluster.
Instead, we'll write the `sleap train` commands from scratch in the next step.

Next you need to create a SLURM batch script, which will schedule the training job
on the HPC cluster. Create a new file called `train-slurm.sh`
(you can do this in the terminal with `nano`/`vim` or in a text editor of
your choice on your local PC/laptop). Here we create the script in the same folder
as the training job, but you can save it anywhere you want, or even keep track of it with `git`.

```{code-block} console
$ nano train-slurm.sh
```

An example is provided below, followed by explanations.
```{code-block} bash
:linenos:
#!/bin/bash

SLP_JOB_DIR=$SLP_DIR/$SLP_JOB_NAME

# Go to the job directory
cd $SLP_JOB_DIR

# Run the training for each model
sleap train --config-name centroid.yaml --config-dir . trainer_config.ckpt_dir="$SLP_DIR/models"
sleap train --config-name centered_instance.yaml --config-dir . trainer_config.ckpt_dir="$SLP_DIR/models"
```

:::{dropdown} Explanation of the batch script
:color: info
:icon: info
- `#SBATCH` lines are SLURM directives specifying the resources needed for the job.
  See our [SLURM primer](slurm-arguments-target) and the [SLURM documentation](https://slurm.schedmd.com/sbatch.html) for details.

- `--ntasks-per-node=1` tells SLURM to launch one process per node. PyTorch Lightning
  (which SLEAP uses internally) requires this form rather than `--ntasks` or `-n`;
  Lightning then manages GPU parallelism within that single process.
  `--cpus-per-task=8` allocates CPU cores to that process for data loading and preprocessing.

- `--gres gpu:a100:1` requests 1 GPU of type A100. To request any available GPU, use `--gres gpu:1`.
  Inspect available GPU types by listing the nodes in the `gpu` and `gpu_lowp` partitions:
    ```{code-block} console
    $ sinfo -p gpu,gpu_lowp -o "%N %G" --noheader
    ```
    Look for the string between `gpu:` and the next `:` (e.g. `a100`, `l40s`).
    Avoid GPUs with CUDA compute capability below 7.5 (unsupported by PyTorch ≥ 2.5);
    at the time of writing, only `p5000` cards are incompatible.
    See the [SWC wiki](https://liveuclac.sharepoint.com/sites/SSC/SitePages/SSC-CPU-and-GPU-Platform-architecture-165449857.aspx)
    and the [NVIDIA CUDA GPUs page](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda/gpus) for compute capabilities.

- `module load SLEAP` loads the latest SLEAP module and its dependencies.
  PyTorch bundles its own CUDA runtime, so no separate `cuda` module is needed.

- `cd $SLP_JOB_DIR` is needed because `--config-dir .` in the `sleap train` commands
  uses a relative path to find the YAML configuration files.

- Each `sleap train` call trains one model: `--config-name` selects the YAML file,
  `--config-dir` the directory containing it, and `trainer_config.ckpt_dir`
  sets where the trained model files will be saved.
:::

:::{dropdown} Legacy training commands (TensorFlow modules)
:color: info
:icon: info

If you are using a legacy SLEAP module (≤ 1.4.1, TensorFlow backend),
the training commands use `sleap-train` with JSON config files:

```{code-block} bash
sleap-train centroid.json labels.v002.pkg.slp
sleap-train centered_instance.json labels.v002.pkg.slp
```

The exported training job package from legacy SLEAP also includes a
`train-script.sh` that contains these commands, so you can simply run
`./train-script.sh` from the SLURM script. See the legacy SLEAP
[remote training guide](https://legacy.sleap.ai/guides/remote.html#remote-training)
and the [legacy CLI reference](https://legacy.sleap.ai/guides/cli.html) for details.
:::

:::{warning}
Before submitting the job, ensure that you have permissions to execute
the SLURM batch script. You can make it executable by running:

```{code-block} console
$ chmod +x train-slurm.sh
```
:::

Now you can submit the batch script via running the following command
(in the same directory as the script):
```{code-block} console
$ sbatch train-slurm.sh
Submitted batch job 3445652
```

You may monitor the progress of the job in various ways:

::::{tab-set}

```{dropdown} Out-of-memory (OOM) errors
:color: warning
:icon: alert-fill

If you encounter out-of-memory errors, keep in mind that there are two main sources of memory usage:
- CPU memory (RAM), specified via the `--mem` argument in the SLURM batch script. This is the memory used by the Python process running the training job and is shared among all the CPU cores.
- GPU memory, this is the memory used by the GPU card(s) and depends on the GPU card type you requested via the `--gres gpu:1` argument in the SLURM batch script. To increase it, you can request a specific GPU card type with more GPU memory (e.g. `--gres gpu:a100:1`). The SWC wiki provides a [list of all GPU card types and their specifications](https://liveuclac.sharepoint.com/sites/SSC/SitePages/SSC-CPU-and-GPU-Platform-architecture-165449857.aspx).
- If requesting more memory doesn't help, you can try reducing the size of your SLEAP models. You may tweak the model backbone architecture, or play with *Input scaling*, *Max stride* and *Batch size*. See SLEAP's [documentation](https://docs.sleap.ai/) and [discussion forum](https://github.com/talmolab/sleap/discussions) for more details.
```

(model-evaluation)=
## Model evaluation
Upon successful completion of the training job, a `models` folder will have
been created in your specified `trainer_config.ckpt_dir`.
It contains one subfolder per training run.

```{code-block} console
$ cd /ceph/scratch/neuroinformatics-dropoff/SLEAP_HPC_test_data
$ cd models
$ ls -1
'260512_151547.centroid.n=46'
'260512_151547.centered_instance.n=46'
```

Each subfolder holds the trained model files (e.g. `best.ckpt`),
their configurations (`training_config.yaml`) and some evaluation metrics.

```{code-block} console
$ cd '260512_151547.centroid.n=46'
$ ls -1
best.ckpt
initial_config.yaml
labels_gt.train.0.slp
labels_gt.val.0.slp
labels_pr.train.0.slp
labels_pr.val.0.slp
metrics.train.0.npz
metrics.val.0.npz
training_config.yaml
training_log.csv
```
The SLEAP GUI on your local machine can be used to quickly evaluate the trained models.

- Select *Predict* -> *Evaluation Metrics for Trained Models...*
- Click on *Add Trained Models(s)* and select the folder containing the model(s) you want to evaluate.
- You can view the basic metrics on the shown table or you can also view a more detailed report (including plots) by clicking *View Metrics*.

For more detailed evaluation metrics, you can refer to [SLEAP's model evaluation notebook](https://docs.sleap.ai/latest/notebooks/Model_evaluation/).

(sleap-inference)=
## Model inference
By inference, we mean using a trained model to predict the labels on new frames/videos.
SLEAP provides the `sleap track` command line utility for running inference
on a single video or a folder of videos.
See the [remote inference guide](https://docs.sleap.ai/latest/guides/running-sleap-remotely/#remote-inference) for more details.

Below is an example SLURM batch script that contains a `sleap track` call.
```{code-block} bash
:linenos:
#!/bin/bash

#SBATCH -J slp_infer # job name
#SBATCH -p gpu # partition
#SBATCH -N 1   # number of nodes
#SBATCH --mem 64G # memory pool for all cores
#SBATCH --ntasks-per-node=1 # one process per node
#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=16  # CPU cores available to the process
#SBATCH -t 0-02:00 # time (D-HH:MM)
#SBATCH --gres gpu:a100:1 # request 1 GPU of a given type
#SBATCH -o slurm.%x.%N.%j.out # write STDOUT
#SBATCH -e slurm.%x.%N.%j.err # write STDERR
#SBATCH --mail-type=ALL
#SBATCH --mail-user=user@domain.com

# Print GPU info
nvidia-smi

# Load the SLEAP module
module load SLEAP

# Define directory for SLEAP project
SLP_DIR=/ceph/scratch/neuroinformatics-dropoff/SLEAP_HPC_test_data

# Make a directory to store the predictions (if it doesn't exist already)
mkdir -p $SLP_DIR/predictions

# Run the inference command
sleap track \
    -i $SLP_DIR/mice.mp4 \
    -m $SLP_DIR/models/260512_151547.centroid.n=46 \
    -m $SLP_DIR/models/260512_151547.centered_instance.n=46 \
    -d auto \
    -b 4 \
    --tracking \
    -o $SLP_DIR/predictions/labels.v002.predictions.slp
```
The script is very similar to the training script, with the following differences:
- The time limit `-t` is set lower, since inference is normally faster than training. This will however depend on the size of the video and the number of models used.
- The requested `--cpus-per-task` and `--mem` are higher. This will depend on the requirements of the specific job you are running. It's best practice to try with a scaled-down version of your data first, to get an idea of the resources needed.
- You can request a specific GPU type with `--gres gpu:<type>:1` (e.g. `--gres gpu:a100:1`). The different GPU types vary in GPU memory size and compute capabilities (see [the SWC wiki](https://liveuclac.sharepoint.com/sites/SSC/SitePages/SSC-CPU-and-GPU-Platform-architecture-165449857.aspx)).
- The `sleap train` calls are replaced by the `sleap track` command.
- The `\` character is used to split the long `sleap track` command into multiple lines for readability. It is not necessary if the command is written on a single line.

:::{dropdown} Legacy inference commands (TensorFlow modules)
:color: info
:icon: info

If you are using a legacy SLEAP module (≤ 1.4.1, TensorFlow backend),
inference is run with `sleap-track` and JSON config files:

```{code-block} bash
sleap-track video.mp4 \
    -m models/centroid/training_config.json \
    -m models/centered_instance/training_config.json \
    --gpu auto \
    --tracking.tracker simple \
    --tracking.similarity centroid \
    -o predictions.slp
```

See the [legacy SLEAP CLI reference](https://legacy.sleap.ai/guides/cli.html) for details.
:::

You can submit and monitor the inference job in the same way as the training job.
```{code-block} console
$ sbatch infer-slurm.sh
$ squeue --me
```
Upon completion, a `labels.v002.predictions.slp` file will have been created in the `predictions` directory.

You can use the SLEAP GUI on your local machine to load and view the predictions:
*File* -> *Open Project...* -> select the `labels.v002.predictions.slp` file.


## The training-inference cycle

Now that you have some predictions, you can keep improving your models by repeating
the training-inference cycle.

This predictions file has the same format as a standard SLEAP project file,
and you can use the GUI (on your local machine) to manually correct the predictions
or merge them into an existing SLEAP project.

For example, you can:

- [Manually correct](https://docs.sleap.ai/latest/tutorial/correcting-predictions/) some of the predictions
- Merge corrected labels into the initial training set (*File* -> *Merge into Project...*).
- Save the merged training set under a new name, e.g. `labels.v003.slp`
- Export a new training job `labels.v003.slp.training_job` (you may reuse the training configurations from before)
- Repeat the training-inference cycle until satisfied

## Troubleshooting

### Problems with the SLEAP module

In this section, we will describe how to test that the SLEAP module is loaded
correctly for you and that it can use the available GPUs.

Login to the HPC cluster as described [above](access-to-the-hpc-cluster).

Start an interactive job on a GPU node. This step is necessary, because we need
to test the module's access to the GPU.
```{code-block} console
$ srun -p gpu --gres=gpu:1 --pty bash -i
```
:::{dropdown} Explain the above command
:color: info
:icon: info

* `-p gpu` requests a node from the 'gpu' partition (queue)
* `--gres=gpu:1` requests 1 GPU of any kind. Use `--gres=gpu:<type>:1` to request a specific GPU type (e.g. `--gres=gpu:a100:1`).
*  `--pty` is short for 'pseudo-terminal'
*  The `-i` stands for 'interactive'

Taken together, the above command will start an interactive bash terminal session
on a node of the 'gpu' partition, equipped with 1 GPU card.
:::

First, let's verify that you are indeed on a node equipped with a functional
GPU, by typing `nvidia-smi`:

Your output should look similar to the above. You will be able to see the GPU
name, temperature, memory usage, etc. If you see an error message instead,
(even though you are on a GPU node) please contact the SWC Scientific Computing team.

Next, load the SLEAP module.
```{code-block} console
$ module load SLEAP
```

The quickest way to verify that SLEAP is correctly installed and can access
the GPU is to run the built-in diagnostic command:
```{code-block} console
$ sleap doctor
```
This will print system information, package versions, and confirm whether a GPU
was detected. Look for the `[GPU / CUDA]` section to confirm GPU support.

To verify manually via the Python interpreter:
```{code-block} console
$ python
```

```{code-block} pycon
>>> import sleap
>>> import torch
>>> torch.cuda.is_available()
True
>>> torch.cuda.get_device_name(0)
'Quadro RTX 5000'
```

If all is as expected, you can exit the Python interpreter, and then exit the GPU node:
```{code-block} pycon
>>> exit()
```
```{code-block} console
$ exit
```

:color: info
:icon: info

If you are using a legacy SLEAP module (≤ 1.4.1), the verification
steps use TensorFlow instead of PyTorch:

```{code-block} pycon
>>> import sleap
>>> sleap.versions()
>>> sleap.system_summary()
>>> import tensorflow as tf
>>> print(tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU'))
>>> tf.constant("Hello world!")
```

For details, see the [legacy SLEAP installation guide](https://legacy.sleap.ai/installation.html#testing-that-things-are-working).
:::

If you encounter troubles with using the SLEAP module, contact
Niko Sirmpilatze of the SWC [Neuroinformatics Unit](https://neuroinformatics.dev/).

To completely exit the HPC cluster, you will need to type `exit` or
`logout` until you are back to the terminal prompt of your local machine.
See [Set up SSH for the SWC HPC cluster](../programming/SSH-SWC-cluster.md)
for more information.
