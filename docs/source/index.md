# Neuroinformatics Unit HowTo

On this website you can find long-form how-to guides as well as collections of small tips and tricks related to data analysis and software development in neuroscience.

The webiste is maintained by members of the [Neuroinformatics Unit](https://neuroinformatics.dev). The information is primarily aimed at researchers at the [Sainsbury Wellcome Centre (SWC)](https://www.sainsburywellcome.org/web/) and [Gatsby Computational Neuroscience Unit (GCNU)](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/gatsby/gatsby-computational-neuroscience-unit), though most of it should be useful to neuroscientists in general.


## Main sections
The guides are organised into three main sections:
