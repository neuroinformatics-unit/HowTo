# Neuroinformatics Unit HowTo

On this website you can find long-form how-to guides as well as collections of small tips and tricks related to data analysis and software development in neuroscience.

The website is maintained by members of the [Neuroinformatics Unit](https://neuroinformatics.dev).
The information is primarily aimed at researchers at the [Sainsbury Wellcome Centre (SWC)](https://www.sainsburywellcome.org/web/)
and
[Gatsby Computational Neuroscience Unit (GCNU)](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/gatsby/gatsby-computational-neuroscience-unit),
though most of it should be useful to neuroscientists in general.
