# Data Sharing

## Background

Data is key to neuroscience, and it should be shared for maximal utility. There is increasing pressure from funders and publishers to share data alongside publications:

**Wellcome:**

> “We expect our researchers to maximise the availability of research data, software and materials with as few restrictions as possible. As a minimum, the data underpinning research papers should be made available to other researchers at the time of publication, as well as any original software that is required to view datasets or to replicate analyses.”

**Cell Press:**

> “All datasets that are composed of standardized datatypes and reported in Cell Press papers must be deposited in a datatype-specific, Cell-Press-recommended repository before a paper is accepted for publication.”

> “All original code must be either deposited in a repository that mints DOIs or included in the supplemental information before a paper is accepted for publication.”


## Requirements

Currently, SWC does not have any specific code and data sharing requirements, but your funder or publisher may do. 

**Ideally, all data and code will be shared in such a way that any other researcher could easily reproduce key figures from a publication, and build on those data and software in their own research.**


## Code
Original code can be hosted in a public GitHub/GitLab repository, hosted on an organisational account (i.e. not an individual account). This could be the [SWC organisation](https://github.com/SainsburyWellcomeCentre), or that of a particular team, lab or collaboration. To enable re-use, code should include an [appropriate license](https://howto.neuroinformatics.dev/guides/Licensing.html).

To ensure a permanent archive of the code associated with a publication a [DOI](https://www.doi.org/) should be created (e.g. using [Zenodo](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/archiving-a-github-repository/referencing-and-citing-content)). 

## Data
### Repository
There are [many repositories](repo-table) that will accept the types of data generated by SWC. They come into three categories, general, neuroscience-specific and modality-specific.  If you do not have a preference, we recommended:

**For small (<20GB) datasets:**
Use the existing [SWC section of the UCL FigShare instance](https://rdr.ucl.ac.uk/The_Sainsbury_Wellcome_Centre). This is easy to use, and is supported centrally by UCL

**For larger datasets:**
Create a GIN repository, ideally within the [SWC organisation](https://gin.g-node.org/SainsburyWellcomeCentre). GIN uses Git and provides a versioning system, making it particularly well suited for ongoing research projects.

**Specific modalities:**
In some cases, there may be a modality or field-specific repository that would be best suited for the data (or mandated by the publisher), some examples include:
- [Brain Image Library](http://www.brainimagelibrary.org/) - Large brain image datasets
- [DANDI](https://dandiarchive.org/) - Electrophysiology, optophysiology, behavioural time-series (must be in NWB format)
- [BioImage Archive](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/bioimage-archive/) - Biological images

In all cases, using a repository that can create a [DOI](https://www.doi.org/) will help increase citations.

### Structure
There is no single best way to structure your data, but it must be in a form that allows users to easily re-use it for their own purposes. This may be by adopting specific file formats (such as [NeuroData Without Borders](https://www.nwb.org/)). Alternatively the data could be organised within a standardised project folder structure. Many labs have their own system, but those starting from scratch may wish to use the [SWC-Blueprint data structure](https://swc-blueprint.neuroinformatics.dev/).

**However the data is structured, all relevant metadata must be included with the raw data.**
