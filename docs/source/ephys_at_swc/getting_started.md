# Getting Started

With numerous acquisition, preprocessing and analysis
steps to consider, getting started with extracellular electrophysiology
is not easy!

To get started, the [Resources](resources) section has links to articles
for a general introduction to extracellular electrophysiology (as well as
more technical readings for a deeper background).

It is useful to get advice on your particular
experimental setup and research question early on. See the
[Community](community) sections for details on where to get help.

We recommend
[SpikeInterface](https://github.com/SpikeInterface/spikeinterface),
an open source community toolkit for extracellular electrophysiology,
for preprocessing and spike sorting. To begin
building your pipeline, the
[SpikeInterface](https://spikeinterface.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
documentation is a good starting point. See the
[Example Pipelines](example_pipelines/index)
page for researchers at the SWC who would be happy
to answer any questions you might have.
