# Getting Started

With numerous acquisition, preprocessing and analysis
steps to consider, getting started with extracellular electrophysiology
is not easy!

To get started, the [Resources](resources) section has links to articles
for a general introduction to extracellular electrophysiology (as well as
more technical reading  for deeper background).

It is useful to get for advice on around your particular
experimental setup and research question early on. See the
[Community](community) sections for details on where to get help.

We recommend
[SpikeInterace](https://github.com/SpikeInterface/spikeinterface),
an open source community toolkit for extracellular electrophysiology,
for preprocessing and spike sorting. To get
started with pipeline building, the
[SpikeInterface](https://spikeinterface.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
documentation is a good starting point. We also have
[Examples](gallery/index)
from researchers at the SWC who'd be happy to answer any questions you might have.
