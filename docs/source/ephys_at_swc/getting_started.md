# Getting Started

Getting started with extracellular electrophysiology can be intimidating!
With numerous acquisition setups, software packages, preprocessing, postprocessing,
and analysis steps to consider, it's understandable to feel daunted.

A good first step in getting started is to ask for advice. Every setup
and experiment is different, and it's often most effective to
seek guidance early on. See the [Community](community)
sections for details on where to get help.

Before diving into the analysis, it can be useful to get an understanding
for the history and landscape of extracellular electrophysiology.
See the resources section for [general introductions](#general-introduction)
as well as more technical reading for deeper background.

INTRODUCE SPIKEINTERFACE

To get started with pipeline building, the
[SpikeInterface](#spikeinterface) resources are a good starting point.
