# Getting Started 

Getting started with extracellular electrophysiolgoy is intimidating! There are 
many different acquisition setups, packages, preprocessing, postprocessing and 
analysis steps to consider.

A first step in getting started can be to ask for advice for your setup. Every setup
and experiment is different, and it is usually most efficient to be pointed 
in the right direction from the outset rahter than waste time exploring avenues
that end up fruitless. See the [Community](#community_and_roadmap.md) sections for
details on where to get help.

Another step in getting started with electrophysiology analysis is
to read some general introduction guides, see the resources step.

After this, diving right into the preprocessing and analysis on a 
dataset you have collected is useful to see what issues might come up.
We have a selection of examples in use at the SWC from rsearchers
that you can try and out contact if you have questions (both spikeinterface
and otherwise).

Spikeinterface also has a lot of examples.
