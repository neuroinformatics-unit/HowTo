# Getting Started

With the numerous acquisition setups, software packages, preprocessing, postprocessing,
and analysis steps to consider, how to get started with extracellular electrophysiology
is not always clear.

A good first step is to ask for advice around your particular 
experimental setup and research question. Every setup
and experiment is different, and it's often most effective to
seek guidance early on. See the [Community](community)
sections for details on where to get help.

Before diving into the analysis, it can be useful to get an understanding
for the history and landscape of extracellular electrophysiology.
See the resources section for [general introductions](#general-introduction)
as well as more technical reading for deeper background.

For preprocessing and spike sorting, we recommend 
[SpikeInterace](https://github.com/SpikeInterface/spikeinterface),
an open source community toolkit for extracellular electrophysiology. To get 
started with pipeline building, the
[SpikeInterface](https://spikeinterface.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) 
documentation is a good starting point. We also have
[Examples](gallery/index)
from researchers at the SWC who'd be happy to answer any questions you might have.
