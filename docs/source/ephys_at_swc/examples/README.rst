Example Pipelines
==================

This page holds example pipelines for researchers
at the SWC. It details their setup, experimental
paradigms along with the pipelines they
use for preprocessing / analysis. Take a look
through and feel free to get in contact with
anyone through Slack.

Below are a set of SpikeInterface scripts
for preprocessing and sorting of data
from a range of experimental setups. Also
see the list of repositories with code for
mutlimodal analysis including
electrophysiology
in
:ref:`Python <python_examples>`
and
:ref:`Matlab <matlab_examples>`.
