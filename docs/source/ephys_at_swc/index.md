# Electrophysiology at the SWC

This page acts as an information hub for researchers using
extracellular electrophysiology in the SWC. It contains
[guides](getting_started.md)
for preprocessing and analysis, as well as
[example scripts](examples_from_the_swc.md)
in use by researchers in the building.

We encourage all types of contributions. If you've like to contribute a guide or pipeline,
please don't hesitate to get in contact! See the
[Community](community.md)
page for more details.

This page is maintained by the [Neuroinformatics Unit](https://neuroinformatics.dev).
We are focused on building community tools to automate
and centralise electrophysiology analysis. If you'd
like to read more about our plans, please visit our
[Roadmap]().
