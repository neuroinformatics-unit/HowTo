# Electrophysiology

This page acts as an information source for researchers using
extracellular electrophysiology in the SWC. It contains
[Resources](resources.md) providing background on
the technique, as well as
[Example Pipelines](auto_examples_ephys/index)
used researchers in the building.

We encourage all types of contributions. If you've like to contribute a
guide or pipeline, please don't hesitate to get in contact! See the
[Community](community.md)
page for more details.

This page is maintained by the [Neuroinformatics Unit](https://neuroinformatics.dev).
We are focused on building community tools to automate
and centralise electrophysiology analysis.
