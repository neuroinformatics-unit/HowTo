# Electrophysiology

This page serves as an information source for researchers using
extracellular electrophysiology at the SWC. It contains
useful [resources](resources.md) for learning, as well as
[example pipelines](example_pipelines/index)
used by researchers in the building.

We encourage all types of contributions. If you'd like to contribute a
guide or pipeline, please don't hesitate to get in touch! See the
[community](community.md)
page for more details.

This page is maintained by the [Neuroinformatics Unit](https://neuroinformatics.dev).
We are focused on building community tools to automate
and standardise electrophysiology analysis.
