Matlab Examples
===============

Mateo Velez-Fort investigates the integration of visual
and vestibular information in the visual cortex with the
Margrie lab's 'Translocator' setup. They use
SpikeGLX and Neuropixels 2.0 for actute recordings from the
primary visual cortex and other cortical areas. The MATLAB
pipeline is available
[here](https://github.com/SainsburyWellcomeCentre/rc2_analysis).

TODO: consider whether to include papers or not.

Andrei Khilkevich (Mrsic-Flogel lab) performs
acute recordings in a visual-change detection decision making task.
They use NP1.0 probe with SpikeGLX in a head-fixed preparation with
2 probes (often, but sometimes not) recording different regions across
the whole brain. Their pipeline is available [here1], [here2], [here3].
