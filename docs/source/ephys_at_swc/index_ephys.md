# Extracellular Electrophysiology at the SWC

This page aims to act as a hub for researchers using extracellular electrophysiology in the SWC. It contains
guides for preprocessing and analysis, as well as examples currently in use by researchers in the building.

Please make sure to join the #extracellular-electrophysiology channel on the SWC Slack for discussions. 
If you've like to contribute a guide or pipeline, please don't hesitate to get in contact! [See community and roadmap].

This page is maintained by the [Neuroinformatics Unit](neuroinformatics.dev), in particular by Joe Ziminski. 
Please feel free to get in contact through Slack or by email anytime (j.ziminski@ucl.ac.uk).
