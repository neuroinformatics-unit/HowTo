# Community

This site is maintained by the
[NeuroInformatics Unit](https://neuroinformatics.dev/).
Please don't hesitate to contact us
(in particular Joe Ziminski) on Slack with any questions or feedback.

For information and advice on electrophysiology from the SWC community, the
best place to go is the `#forum-extracellular-ephys` channel on the SWC Slack.

Outside the SWC, you can address any questions or issues about
[SpikeInterface](https://github.com/SpikeInterface)
by raising an issue on their
[GitHub repository](https://github.com/SpikeInterface/spikeinterface/issues).
They are very friendly and
happy to answer any questions!

In addition, the
[Neuropixels](https://neuropixelsgroup.slack.com/)
Slack channel is a great resource, with an active community discussing
extracellular electrophysiology acquisition and analysis.
