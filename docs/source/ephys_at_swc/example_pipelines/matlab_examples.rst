Matlab Pipelines
=================

Multi-probe Neuropixels 1.0
---------------------------

Andrei Khilkevich (Mrsic-Flogel lab) performs
acute recordings in a visual change-detection decision
-making task.
Two implanted probes (NP 1.0) in a head-fixed preparation are used to
simultaneously record different regions across the whole brain.
Their pipeline is available
`here <https://github.com/BaselLaserMouse/Khilkevich_Lohse_2024/tree/main/NPX-postprocessing-pipeline>`__.

Automated pipeline for multimodal integration
---------------------------------------------

Mateo Velez-Fort (Margie Lab) investigates the integration of visual
and vestibular information in the visual cortex with the
Margrie lab's 'Translocator' setup. They use
Neuropixels 2.0 (acquired using [SpikeGLX](https://github.com/billkarsh/SpikeGLX)) for acute recordings from the
primary visual cortex and other cortical areas as the head-fixed
mouse is physically displaced along a track.
The pipeline is available
`here <https://github.com/SainsburyWellcomeCentre/rc2_analysis>`__.
