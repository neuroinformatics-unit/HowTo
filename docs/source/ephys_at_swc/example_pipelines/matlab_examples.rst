Matlab Pipelines
=================

Multi-probe Neuropixels 1.0
---------------------------

Andrei Khilkevich (Mrsic-Flogel lab) performs
acute recordings in a visual change-detection decision making task.
A head-fixed preparation recording from 2 implanted probes (NP 1.0)
simultaneously to record different regions across the whole brain.
Their pipeline is available
`here <https://github.com/BaselLaserMouse/Khilkevich_Lohse_2024/tree/main/NPX-postprocessing-pipeline>`__.

Automated pipeline for multimodal integration
---------------------------------------------

Mateo Velez-Fort (Margie Lab) investigates the integration of visual
and vestibular information in the visual cortex with the
Margrie lab's 'Translocator' setup. They use
Neuropixels 2.0 (SpikeGLX) for acute recordings from the
primary visual cortex and other cortical areas as the head-fixed
mouse is physically displaced along a track.
The pipeline is available
`here <(https://github.com/SainsburyWellcomeCentre/rc2_analysis>`__.
