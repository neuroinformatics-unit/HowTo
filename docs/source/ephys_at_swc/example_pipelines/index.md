# Examples

This page shares extracellular electrophysiology pipelines in use by researchers across the SWC.

These examples aim to demonstrate the possibilities for ephys
pipeline building rather than serve as drop-in tools for
data processing. However, please feel free to get in
contact with any listed researchers to ask questions
or for advice!
