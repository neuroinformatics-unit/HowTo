Python Pipelines
================

Multiple probes (Cambridge Neurotech)
-------------------------------------

Dammy Onih
(`Akrami lab <https://www.sainsburywellcome.org/web/groups/akrami-lab>`__)
is running a multi-session paradigm with two
`Cambridge Neurotech <https://www.cambridgeneurotech.com/neural-probes>`__
probes. In this multi-session task, mice learn a statistical learning paradigm to a
reward-associated auditory stimulus, recording from the hippocampus.
The pipeline uses SpikeInterface for preprocessing,
sorting, and analysis and can be found `here <https://github.com/AOONIH/ephys/tree/master>`__.

The IBL analysis pipeline
-------------------------

Nate Miska (`Mrsic-Flogel lab <https://www.sainsburywellcome.org/web/groups/mrsic-flogel-lab>`__)
is a member of the
`International Brain Laboratory
(IBL) <https://www.internationalbrainlab.com/>`_
running the
`IBL's standardised behavioural task <https://elifesciences.org/articles/63711>`_
with acute Neuropixels 1.0 recordings. Details of the
`analysis pipeline code <https://github.com/int-brain-lab/ibl-neuropixel>`__
on the IBL data management system can be found
