Python Pipelines
================

Multiple probes (Cambridge Neurotech)
-------------------------------------

Dammy Onih (Akrami lab) is running a multi-session paradigm with two
`Cambridge Neurotech <https://www.cambridgeneurotech.com/neural-probes>`__
probes. In this multi-session task, a mice learns a statistic learning paradigm to a
reward-associated auditory stimulus, recording from the hippocampus.
The pipeline uses SpikeInterface for preprocessing,
sorting and analysis and can be found `here <https://github.com/AOONIH/ephys/tree/master>`__.

The IBL analysis pipeline
-------------------------

Nate Miska (Mrsic-Flogel lab) is a member of the
`International Brain Laboratory
(IBL) <(https://www.internationalbrainlab.com/>`_
running the
`IBL's standardised behavioural task <https://elifesciences.org/articles/63711>`_
with acute Neuropixels 1.0 recordings. See the
`analysis pipeline code <https://github.com/int-brain-lab/ibl-neuropixel>`__
details on the IBL data management system can be found
`here <https://int-brain-lab.github.io/iblenv/index.html>`_.

Integrated analysis with Neuropixels 2.0
----------------------------------------

Steve Lenzi (Margrie Lab) has an integrated pipeline for automated behavioural,
electrophysiological and anatomical analysis. Steve works with an
mutli-session escape paradigm recording stimulus-responsive neurons in the posterior
striatum. He is using NeuroPixels 2.0 and SpikeGLX with a spikeinterface-based
pipeline, the code can be found `here <https://github.com/stephenlenzi/npix_lse>`__.
