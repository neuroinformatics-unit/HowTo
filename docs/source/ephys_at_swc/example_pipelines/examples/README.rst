Python Repo Examples
====================

DETAILS
--------

(TODO: mention where they do / do not use spikeinterface)
Steve Lenzi (Margrie Lab) is an early adopter of spikewrap (dev version) [REMOVE ALL SPIKEWRAP]
and has integrated it into a repository for automated behavioural,
electrophysiological and anatomical analysis. Steve works with an
escape paradigm recording stimulus-responsive neurons in the posterior
striatum (check) across multiple sessions. He is using NeuroPixels
and SpikeGLX and is repository is [here]().

Mutli-probe Cambridge Neurotech [TODO]
--------------------------------------

Dammy Onih is running a multi-session paradigm with two
Cambridge Neurotech probes LINK. In this task, a mice learns
a statistic learning paradigm with auditory stimulus (MORE DETAIL?)
and recordings for the hippocampus are understanding to XXX signatures
of learning. The pipeline uses SpikeInterface for preprocessing,
sorting and analysis and can be found [here]().

[Some behaviour] with the IBL pipeline
--------------------------------------

Nate Miska (Mrsic-Flogel lab) is a member of the
[International Brain Laboratory (IBL)](https://www.internationalbrainlab.com/)
running the IBL task XXX with acute recordings. Neuropixels 1.0
IBLRIG. See the analysis pipeline [XXX]() and details on the
IBL data management system can be found [here]().
