Python Analysis Repo Examples
=============================

Multi-probe Cambridge Neurotech
--------------------------------------

Dammy Onih (Akrami lab) is running a multi-session paradigm with two
[Cambridge Neurotech](https://www.cambridgeneurotech.com/neural-probes)
probes. In this multi-session task, a mice learns a statistic learning paradigm to a
reward-associated auditory stimulus, recording from the hippocampus.
The pipeline uses SpikeInterface for preprocessing,
sorting and analysis and can be found [here](https://github.com/AOONIH/ephys/tree/master).

The IBL Analysis Pipeline
--------------------------------------

Nate Miska (Mrsic-Flogel lab) is a member of the
[International Brain Laboratory (IBL)](https://www.internationalbrainlab.com/)
running the [IBL's standardised behavioural task](https://elifesciences.org/articles/63711)
with acute Neuropixels 1.0 recordings.
See the analysis pipeline [XXX]() and details on the
IBL data management system can be found [here]().

Automated analysis with Neuropixels 2.0
---------------------------------------

Steve Lenzi (Margrie Lab) has an integrated pipeline for automated behavioural,
electrophysiological and anatomical analysis. Steve works with an
mutli-session escape paradigm recording stimulus-responsive neurons in the posterior
striatum. He is using NeuroPixels 2.0 and SpikeGLX, the pipeline
code can be found [here](https://github.com/stephenlenzi/npix_lse).
