This is the first section!
The `#%%` signifies to Sphinx-Gallery that this text should be rendered as
reST and if using one of the above IDE/plugin's, also signifies the start of a
'code block'.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 14-21

    # This line won't be rendered as reST because there's a space after the last block.
    myvariable = 2
    print("my variable is {}".format(myvariable))
    # This is the end of the 'code block' (if using an above IDE). All code within
    # this block can be easily executed all at once.
