Source code for the [Neuroinformatics Unit HowTo](https://howto.neuroinformatics.dev/) website.

On this website, we keep track of long-form how-to guides as well as collections of small tips and tricks related to data analysis and software development in neuroscience.

The information is primarily aimed at researchers at the [Sainsbury Wellcome Centre (SWC)](https://www.sainsburywellcome.org/web/) and [Gatsby Computational Neuroscience Unit (GCNU)](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/gatsby/gatsby-computational-neuroscience-unit), though most of it should be useful to neuroscientists in general.

If you wish to edit the website, please read the [contributing guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) first.
