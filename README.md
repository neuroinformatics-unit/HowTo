# SWC BIDS

This repository contains our suggestions on how to organise your data and related files. It is inspired by BIDS, but it is not a formal extension of BIDS.

BIDS is a standard for organizing and describing neuroimaging and behavioural data. It is developed and maintained by the [BIDS community](https://bids.neuroimaging.io/). It defines a way to structure your data and metadata within a hierarchy of folders and filenames. It also defines a set of metadata fields that are common to many neuroimaging experiments. We want to expand this standard to include electrophysiology and behavioural experiments and adapt it to the needs of SWC.
